Hello there! 👋

Are you excited to explore OpenAI's powerful models but don't know where to begin? 🤔

If you're non-technical, the problem is clear: OpenAI doesn't provide a user-friendly interface to try out their HTTP APIs. 😔

While several interfaces exist, most are just clones of ChatGPT, allowing you to generate text-based content from prompts. But what about OpenAI’s other incredible models like DALL-E for image generation or TTS for natural-sounding speech? Sadly, without technical skills, experimenting with these becomes difficult. 😢

That’s where Ortlin comes in! 🚀 🎉

Ortiln is a web-based, user-friendly interface designed to help anyone—technical or non-technical—interact with OpenAI’s APIs and underlying models with ease. And the best part? It’s completely free and open-source! 😍

No more barriers—Ortlin puts the power of OpenAI in your hands! 🎉 🔥
